    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I'm a passionate front-end developer currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Business Administration (Computer Applications). I have a strong interest in crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that offer great user experiences. Over the course of my academic journey, Iâ€™ve successfully completed 3 college-level projects that showcase my creativity and technical skills.

I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have hands-on experience working with CHATGPT. I'm also exploring backend technologies such as Python and Flask to become a full-stack developer. I enjoy turning ideas into interactive web applications and am always eager to learn new technologies, improve my design skills, and take on new challenges.

My goal is to build real-world applications that make a difference, collaborate with creative teams, and grow as a professional in the web development industry.
